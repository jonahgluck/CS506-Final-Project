	What data needs to be collected and how you will collect it (e.g. scraping xyz website or polling students).
	How you plan on modeling the data (e.g. clustering, fitting a linear model, decision trees, XGBoost, some sort of deep learning method, etc.).
	How do you plan on visualizing the data? (e.g. interactive t-SNE plot, scatter plot of feature x vs. feature y).
	What is your test plan? (e.g. withhold 20% of data for testing, train on data collected in October and test on data collected in November, etc.).
